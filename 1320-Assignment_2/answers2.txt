a. The difference between private and public inheritance is that in public
you can use and see members of the base class. If you would have used private
then members couldn't be accessed by a derived class.

b. If you do not include a call to a base class constructor then a default
constructor will be called from the derived class. 

c. One example of member functions that are not inherited by the derived class
are private members from the base class. Another example are protected members
because they restrict the access to derived classes, but we can also say that
constructors cannot be inerited.

d.Yes, it is possible for a derived class to have more than one base class and
that is called multiple inheritance. Even though it can occur it is not recommended
because ambiguity may occur.

e. The optimal way of overloading an operator is to use operators for example +,-,%,==,etc.
They are also called built-in operators.
